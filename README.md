# Solar Cycle

_“Although the project is still under construction, it reflects hours of work, research and continuous improvement.”_
 
## Asbtract

Solar Cycle is a visual and interactive simulation that represents the complete cycle of day and night, and how it affects the natural lighting in a home over 24 hours. Developed with OpenGL and 3D modeling techniques, this project seeks to offer an immersive experience in which the user can observe the apparent movement of the Sun and the Moon in the sky, as well as the light changes they generate in the environment.

Currently, the project is under development and the lighting simulation is still in the process of implementation. However, it is already possible to explore the scene and experiment with the camera position to observe the house from different angles. This feature makes it possible to anticipate how the light will strike from different points, providing both visual and educational value on the relationship between celestial movement and natural lighting.

## Steps to clone the repository

As a requirement you must have previously installed libraries such as glfw,assimp, glad and glut. This project does not contain a .sln file (Visual Studio Solution), therefore you must create a project with these libraries.
To compile it, you must manually configure the build environment (e.g. using g++, CMake, or your preferred environment), making sure to include and link the required libraries (glfw, glad, glut) correctly.

To clone the repository, we go to visual studio community, and we choose clone a repository, we put the url and then we click on clone.
